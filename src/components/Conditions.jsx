                        <strong>Membership Agreement:</strong> By becoming a member of Future Sports Gym, you agree to embrace the exhilarating world of fitness and commit to sweating with a smile. Remember, the more you sweat, the more high-fives you earn from our invisible cheering squad.

                        <strong>Dress Code:</strong> We encourage you to wear your most outrageous workout attire. The funkier, the better! Sequins, glitter, and neon colors are highly recommended. Capes and superhero costumes are acceptable on Saturdays.

                        <strong>Noise Level:</strong> Grunting is not only allowed but encouraged, especially during heavy lifting. Feel free to let out your inner superhero battle cries. However, excessive yodeling or interpretative dance routines may be subject to applause.

                        <strong>Equipment Etiquette:</strong> Please wipe down the equipment after use with our provided rainbow-colored towels. If you accidentally break a sweat on the treadmill, consider it a contribution to the gym ambiance.

                        <strong>Personal Trainers:</strong> Our certified personal trainers are experts in creating imaginary workout routines. They specialize in exercises like the "Invisible Rowing" and "Air Squats with Style." Don't be surprised if your trainer challenges you to a dance-off for your warm-up.
